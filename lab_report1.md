Change the password to **the cs15l username** to something that is easy to remember.

Run git bash on VScode and type `ssh cs15lsp23jo@ieng6.ucsd.edu`. Change *jo* to your specific username. Mine happened to be jo.
Type in the password to the username (the one you just changed to). You should be connected after this.
